<h2 class="my-brand">DNS</h2>
DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. <a href="123-reg, GoDaddy"> 123-reg, GoDaddy</a>). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to
 the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time
  to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.
